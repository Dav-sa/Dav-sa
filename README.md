### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I am a data engineer based in Paris, France 🇫🇷
- 👨‍💻 Lately, I've been building a data pipeline that fetches the most viewed articles from the NY times, store them in a bucket, transfer them in a data warehouse and lastly display them using a data vizualisation tool. Check out the results : [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/5e0c73c6-cd02-47e8-9897-0d4c3bbb924d/page/STB4D)
- 💬 I am also working on getting the [AWS Certified Data engineer associate](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-data-engineer-associate/)
- 📫 You can send me an email at : david.personnelle@pm.me or contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsabri/)

Looking forward to connecting !
