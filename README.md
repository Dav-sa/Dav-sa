### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I am a data engineer based in Paris, France 🇫🇷
- 👨‍💻 Lately, I've been building a data pipeline that fetches the most viewed articles from the NY times, store them in a bucket, transfer them in a data warehouse and lastly display them using a data vizualisation tool. 
- 💬 I am also working on getting the AWS Certified Data engineer associate
- 📫 You can send me an email at : david.personnelle@pm.me or contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsabri/)

Looking forward to connecting !
