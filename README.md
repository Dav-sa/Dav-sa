### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± I am a fullstack developer based in France ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·
- ğŸ‘¯ Lately I have been very interested in web3 and have attended [Alchemy's bootcamp](https://university.alchemy.com/overview/ethereum), I also went through the first two challenges of [Speedrun Ethereum](https://github.com/Dav-sa/speedruneth-challenge1)
- ğŸ¤” I have been building a block explorer with Nextjs, TypeScript and TailwindCSS, you can see it live [here](https://chainxplorer.vercel.app/) and check the [code here](https://github.com/Dav-sa/chainxplorer)
- ğŸ”­ I love React but I think it is important to keep an eye on other technologies so I've tried myself at Angular, doing their [Tour of Heroes](https://github.com/Dav-sa/angular-heroes) ! 
- ğŸ’¬ I write about tech stuff [here](https://outoftheblocks.cc)
